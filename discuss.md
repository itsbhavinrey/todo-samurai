# Pitching to product

-   Remove the arrow keys in chart legends and dashboard horizontal scroll
-   Headway to featureBase

# Priority 1

## ask srikant ; why clientFilterTooltip is fixed, 3 resize observer can be 1

MAKE SURE ALL HOVER ICONS ARE PRESHOWN IN MOBILE VIEW
remove react-select

1. stringFilter api call unnecessary
2. onDrop on SaveGroupDim why?
3. textIndependent gradient
4. table tile tooltip
5. dont persist table added if i canceled
6. ellipsize
7. (live issue) marking switcher while pressing dot, no autofocus
8. dashboard header sticky
9. devmode select library
10. json_decode fails for large konom response
11. EventToggler
12. check all 3 iframes on both reports.mn and access.mn (something is broken ; reported issue)
13. Vanilla Laravel; No HMVC, as composer install is breaking right now
14. Sidebar and Widgets clutter
15. histogramMeasure icon height
16. customMeasure dialog toggles right section why the fuck(all Dialogs need a refactor ); well in case of refactor: droppanel, droppanelitem, sidepanel, draggablelist,draggablelistitem
17. text length independent gradient
18. ellipsize is useless
